# CodeBoard

CodeBoard facilitates collaborative code review for programmers. It was built at HackPrinceton, a hackathon hosted at Princeton University. You can view the project on ChallengePost [here](http://challengepost.com/software/codeboard).

CodeBoard was designed to be used in an educational context, but can be easily adapted for use in the industry. With CodeBoard, programmers can post snippets of code for others to review. Code can be reviewed with three different tools: annotations, notes, and comments. Annotations are major criticisms of several lines of code and lie in the margins. Notes are minor suggestions that point to a small part of the code. Comments house a discussion of the code in its entirety at the bottom of the screen. CodeBoard creates a meeting place for new and experienced programmers to review code together and learn from each other.
